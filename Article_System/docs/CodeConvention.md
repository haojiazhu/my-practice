1. File names must be all lowercase and may include underscores (_) or dashes (-), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that your project uses.

2. Each statement is followed by a line-break.

3. Every statement must be terminated with a semicolon. Relying on automatic semicolon insertion is forbidden.

4. When line-wrapping, each line after the first (each continuation line) is indented at least +4 from the original line, unless it falls under the rules of block indentation.

5. Declare all local variables with either const or let. Use const by default, unless a variable needs to be reassigned. The var keyword must not be used.

6. Every local variable declaration declares only one variable: declarations such as let a = 1, b = 2; are not used.

7. Local variables are not **habitually** declared at the start of their containing block or block-like construct. Instead, local variables are declared close to the point they are first used (within reason), to minimize their scope.

8. Include a trailing comma whenever there is a line break between the final element and the closing bracket.


9. Branch name: head-menu-GFW-xxx
